## About Me
------------
I'm a AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist based in New York City, with 10 years of experience solving complex business and technical problems through data. I specialize in end-to-end development of scalable machine learning solutions, and have worked on and led cross-functional teams with projects spanning supervised/unsupervised learning, AutoML, optimization, entity resolution, natural language processing, geospatial analysis, econometrics, marketing analytics and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). 
</br>
</br>
Since 2017, I’ve been working extensively with <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> in both Python and Scala, building high-performance data pipelines and distributed systems, leading to two patents. More recently, I’ve been focused on building applications powered by GenAI and large language models (LLMs), with a strong interest in <a href="https://www.langchain.com/">LangChain</a> and <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langgraph">LangGraph</a> frameworks. I lead with a blend of hands-on technical skill and strategic vision—driven by a passion for technology, a commitment to team growth, and a focus on solving complex problems with real-world impact.
</br>
</br>
With a <a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/ee56a75d-c4e1-4b65-83b7-5ab8e7de9ddc/content">PhD in Computational Applied Mathematics</a> from the <a href="https://oden.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a> I have a strong background in both quantitative methods and scientific software engineering. My focus during graduate school was on researching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuous_Galerkin_method">discontinuous Galerkin methods</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method">finite element methods</a> for simulating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectrochemical_cell">photo-electrochemical solar cells</a> which led me to contribute multiple times to the open source finite element library, <a href="https://www.dealii.org/">deal.ii</a>.
</br>
</br>
In my free time, I proudly serve in the <a href="https://cgaux.org/about.php">U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary</a>, the uniformed volunteer component of the United States Coast Guard. 
</br>
</br>
In another life, I was a competitive athlete and coach in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for over 17 years. During my career I trained with and competed against the best fighters all over the world. In 2012, I won the World Championships and in 2015 achieved the rank of 1st degree Black Belt from 2x Pan American Champion <a href="https://www.ginsbergacademy.com/">Professor Dave Ginsberg</a>. I also had the privlage of coaching hundreds of students and I am proud to have created local, national and world champions. Despite having to stop training, I am grateful for the all experiences and to have had an amazing coach along with great mentors, sponsors, friends, teammates and students.
